# generate tf tree
rosrun tf2_tools view_frames.py
rosrun tf view_frames

Error: (map, odom, base_footprint_wheel) are in a different tree than base_footprint
this error went away for some reason

roslaunch hsrb_gazebo_launch hsrb_megaweb2015_world.launch  # -> tf tree looks correct, can navigate
roslaunch hsrb_gazebo_launch hsrb_apartment_world.launch    # -> tf tree looks correct. Briefly can navigate, then 'Path plan failed. Can not planning.'
roslaunch hsrb_gazebo_launch hsrb_butler_bot_world.launch   # -> works.
